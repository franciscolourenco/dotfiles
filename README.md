# Install
```
git clone https://github.com/franciscolourenco/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./INSTALL.sh
```

INSTALL.sh sets up the dotfiles by symlinking the configuration files found in the **home** directory of this repository. The necessary directory structure will be created inside user `$HOME` if it doesn't exist already. The script asks for user confirmation, before overwriting any files.
It optionally helps the user configure git in the system, and/or configure macOS.

brew.sh contains a list of useful cli utils and GUI apps.
